# Generated Ash Types from BAML

This directory contains Ash type modules automatically generated from BAML schemas.

**Do not edit these files directly.** Instead:
1. Modify the BAML schema files
2. Run `mix ash_baml.gen.types YourBamlClient`
3. Review and commit the changes

Generated files are checked into version control to ensure:
- IDE tooling works correctly (autocomplete, go-to-definition)
- Type definitions are visible and reviewable in PRs
- No runtime surprises from hidden generated code
